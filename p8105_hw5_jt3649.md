### Problem 1

``` r
birthday_sim = function(n_people){
  birthdays = sample(1:365, size = n_people, replace = TRUE) #draw n_people birthdays, each between 1 and 365
  any(duplicated(birthdays)) # return true if any birthday appears more than once
}
```

``` r
n_sims = 10000 # number of simulations
birthday_results = 
  tibble(n = 2:50) |>
  mutate(
    # for each n, do 10000 independent simulations
    sim_results = map(
      n, 
      ~ replicate(n_sims, birthday_sim(.x))
    )
  ) |>
  # turn the logical vectors into long format
  unnest_longer(sim_results, values_to = "shared_birthday") |>
  group_by(n) |>
  summarize(
    prob_shared = mean(shared_birthday), # "TRUE" = 1, "FALSE" = 0"
    .groups = "drop"
  )
head(birthday_results)
```

#### Comment

- When the group sizes are small, the probability of two shared the same
  birthday is close to 0.

- The probability increases as n increases, and is above 0.5 when n is
  approx. 23.

- For relatively larger groups (close to 50), the probability of shared
  birthday approaches 1, indicating it is extremely likely that at least
  two people share a birthday.
